# note.taker

# IDEA
users need to keep track of a lot of information, it's easy to forget or be unable to recall something important. Being able to take persistent notes allows users to have written information available when needed. With this application, users should be allowed to create and save notes, view previously saved notes and delete previously saved notes. This application will use an express backend to save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.
